1. Colors may not be displayed all, because on a page where more than 4 colors are shown, the remaining colors are hidden under the picture (like +2 or +3). - I did not have time to fix it.
Color codes are displayed because on the product page all colors can be presented under the name of one color.
2. At the time of completion, there were 453 pages. Number of requests = 453 * 2. I did not have much time to manage optimization.
3. I have not previously been engaged in parsing html pages and working with streams, therefore it took a lot of time to understand how this can be done and to fix errors.
